Another retire box from HTB. Let have a look ..

![]()

I start as usual with nmap enumeration.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.48 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-28 16:37 EST

```

I also run full port scan..

```bash
nmap -p - -oA nmap/allports 10.10.10.48  
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-28 16:38 EST

32400/tcp open  plex
32469/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1080.92 seconds
```

I have few ports to look into it.

* port 22 is SSH
* port 53 is DNS
* port 80 for HTTP
* port 1193 fiveacross? which i have no idea what it is
* port 32400 plex which is media server to share content 
* port 3246 is unknown

I look into website but did not just blank screen

I run content discovery agains this website

```bash

/admin look really interesting. Lets look into this.

THis is older version of Pi-hole. I start looking for some exploits on internet but most of them require passwords or be authenticated. Pi-hole is dns backlist application to filter unwanted traffic. It was created to be used on raspberry-pi devices. As default this devices come with default credentials (pi:raspberry).

```bash
ssh pi@10.10.10.48

```

I was in. Run sudo -l to see if i can run any program as root

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:/home $ sudo -l

```

I can quicklu run sudo su and become root. When i look into root folder flag was not there

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# cat /root/root.txt 
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```

So flag is somewhere is USB stick. Lets see if any partition is mounted

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# df

I looked into /media/usbstick

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# ls /media/usbstick/
damnit.txt  lost+found
root@raspberrypi:~# cat /media/usbstick/damnit.txt 
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

Hmm this was tricky a little but i used command string on /dev/sdb to get root flag :) 

I look more into ports I did not understand 32469 belong to Plex service. 1193 belong to pihole application called pihole-ftp. I believe Plex was rabbit hole because i never heard about any bypasses for it. 

I hope you enjoy reading it .....
