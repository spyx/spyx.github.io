Hi all. People usually say that you have to make commitment to something you want to really want. I tried to find mentod or someone to commit so I decide to commint in this blog. I will try to use do some HTB machines and buffer overflows so i can be ready.

I know few people say that OSCP is course be it self and they are right. My problem is price especially labs. What about I want to read and watch every tutorial they have to offer. This will take like month (if you have your amazing wife and 2 small kids. :) ) THem i want to try everything from lab.

So I decide to learn other way and try to jump directly into labs and save some money.

Lastly I had commnet section but i decide to remove it. Feel free to hit my on my twitter. DM's open for everyone

Thanks
Marek
